# How to use and implement machine learning and deep learning algorithms?
---
### Introduction
This is my personal project, a synthesis of my work and experience in installing and using algorithms, structures, and methods in machine learning and deep learning.\
**Note:** This is a product originating from many organizations completed by myself. For work that involves collaboration with teams, I have mentioned it in the report section (if any).
